Many revolutionaries like, Simon bar Kokhba, were quickly destroyed by the ruling Roman Empire and never heard of again, except in scarce historical references. Jesus Christ was crucified and almost all his apostles met with grim circumstances. As you read the fates of the many apostles, try to think why anyone would want to spread the Gospel knowing the persecutions of the day. What were the apostles thinking? Did Christ promise a worldly kingdom with many riches? Out of the apostles, who was made wealthy or powerful? In short, it is difficult to explain the survival of Christianity apart from the resurrection. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ac792ec9f3fb0d5721895f278069e98335f6e176.jpg" alt="" title="St. Paul (formerly Saul)"><p>St. Paul was tortured and then beheaded by the evil Emperor Nero at Rome in A.D. 67.
